![Rocambolli The Game](cover_gif.gif)

This is my first platformer. An entry to Ludum-Dare 37.

## Code

I am using my own codes below:

 - **[png-font](https://github.com/ericoporto/png-font) :** for pixel font drawing.

 - **[color.js](https://github.com/ericoporto/TouchyEngine/blob/master/color.js) :** tiny 1.47kb js for color normalization.

 I am also using Howler for sound:

 - **[howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) :** a lib for making audio on webpages easier.
  
## Assets
  
For generating sound assets I used the following:

 - **[BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/) :** a sound creation tool that runs in browser.
 
 - **[BU's Autotracker](https://github.com/iamgreaser/it2everything/blob/master/atrk-bu.py) :** a python script that creates music by itself.
 
My tools for editing things:

 - **[Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) :** All the JS code was written in Gedit.
 
 - **[Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) :** Aseprite is the nicest tool ever written for drawing images. I used Aseprite for drawing - if you look my code you will see how drawing is everything in this game.

 - **[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) :** Audacity is how I edited and fine tuned the audio.
 
 - **[Schism Tracker](http://schismtracker.org/) :** I used this only to convert `.it` from BU's Autotracker to `.wav`.
